- machdep pmltypes
- fix insert/delete on P in test/pmlmachdep; can't realloc/malloc, they're stack-allocated
- add header offsets to test/pmlmachdep
- use a PacketField for SET_CHANNEL
- ensure that diverted packets don't get processed
- check to make sure result codes are always being set
- check all uses of int32_t (signed ints) are okay
- check for mem leaks
- convert get*() functions to use either channels or (ip,port) tuples as destinations (see getversion)
- should we fix byte order on vlan tags?
- name field for scapy Packets
- check for int overflows
- test find
- test movs header offsets
- test divert
- remove DASSERT/asserts
- allow errors in instructions to stop the program (e.g. return from pml_mov)
- is enable_cookie really necessary?
- CRC?
- test newprog
- implement tuntap PML_CHANNEL_UDP4

typical dev table:
    1: lo
    2: eth0
    3: eth1
    4: eth2
    5: br0
